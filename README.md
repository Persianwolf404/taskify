# 🎯 Taskify

**Taskify** is my biggest solo project to date — a bleeding-edge, mobile-responsive task management app built with **Next.js**, custom **3D animations**, and **cinematic transitions** inspired by award-winning websites.

I handcrafted custom **Blender models** and deployed them using **Three.js** and **GSAP**, pushing the boundaries of web interaction and UI storytelling.
